# Backend Directory Development Instructions

- As this backend is meant to run on Linux only due to integration with Docker, please use VSCode to connect via its built-in SSH feature to your vm. To start the VM, first run `VBoxManage startvm "MC_Admin_Dev" --type headless`. To shut down the VM after you're finished, run `VBoxManage controlvm "MC_Admin_Dev" acpipowerbutton`.
